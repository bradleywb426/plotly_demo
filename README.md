# Belly Button Bacteria Biodiversity

# Overview

In this challenge, we used Javascript and Plotly to create an interactive and mobile responsive HTML page that could display the information from a study on Bacteria in the Belly Button based on each Volunteer's ID number. Different volunteers can be accessed using a dropdown menu on the page. The volunteers demograpghic information is displayed in a panel on the left of the page. The top 10 bacteria found in their belly button and number of times they clean their belly button a week are displayed in graphs on the right of the demographic panel. On the bottom of the page is a bubble chart that shows the number of bacteria samples per culture.
